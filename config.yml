# MatrixChecks (CONFIG)
# The optimized checks for Matrix Anticheat, a powerful anticheat for Minecraft.
# For Matrix 5.1.1+
#
# !! NOTE !!
# THIS FILE DOES _NOT_ INCLUDE ANY CHECKS
# INSTALL "checks.yml" TO MAKE USE OF OPTIMIZATIONS
# THIS FILE ONLY INCLUDES MINOR CHANGES TO THE BASE CONFIG! 
#
# These checks may not work perfectly with your server.
# Plugins, software, and performance can all affect how well these checks and the anticheat, in general, will work.
# This is not a drag-and-drop solution! Some values may need to be changed to work best with your setup.
#
# Matrix Anticheat isn't a perfect anticheat. It itself has bugs that we cannot fix.
# These checks aim to mitigate those issues and improve what works well, but there's only so much we can do.
# Tested and configured for survival and minigame servers. Tweak the checks for your own server!
